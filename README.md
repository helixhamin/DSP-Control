# DSP-Control

Warning, this is aimed at single PC server installation. If you split your server installations between computers, I don't recommend using this. I will add in multiple PC server installs in the future, but that is not my current focus. If you are interested in adding the functionality, just do a pull and I will look at it and let you know.

You can find the feature list, and where to find the variables at: https://github.com/helixhamin/DSP-Control/wiki

This is created for Windows, and will use the Windows Visual Studio to assemble. This is my learning program, so I can only give limited assistance, and cannot assist for non-Windows or other IDEs.
